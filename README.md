Android task Create an android application that allows a user to take a picture that is saved to gallery. Requirements 1. Do NOT use ready-made views/libraries or open the stock camera app through new intent - access the camera API from scratch. 2. Find a way to achieve the highest framerate possible on a device. 3. Use Andoid Studio for this task. 4. Initialize a git repository at the start of this task and use it as you would for a real task, except don't branch out as you are working alone and it's a small task. 5. Once finished, upload your code to a private bitbucket repository and share it with gatis.g@entangle.tech 6. Explain your choice of solution, shortly describe problems that arose while developing this task and if/how you solved them. Bonus points If you find the requirements too easy, try and find out how you can get a stable frame rate in any situation and how possible it is with different devices/code approaches. Notes Remember to not spend too much time on this! Keep it simple and remember - any solution is good as long as you can argument why it suits the task. If you get stuck, message us and our developers might give you some advice.
